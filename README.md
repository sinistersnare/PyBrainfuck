PyBrainfuck
===========

yet another brainfuck implementation!
--------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

im planning on extending this implementation as much as it can be extended.

Right now it has two options:

* File: which lets you selec a file in the same directory. Try out `python pybf.py -f test.bf` and see how it works!

* Repl: this has very basic functionality right now, where it doesnt save state. use `python pybf.py -r prompttext` for a prompt!

* Repl is default, if you do not choose any commands, then the default prompt is `bf>`



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

* other stuff! 
* (ideas, anyone?) 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal with this is to extend brainfuck to not be a complete pain, but be actually somewhat not really useful!

Its good to know more programming languages!

About brainfuck (from wikipedia):

The brainfuck programming language is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism. It is a Turing tarpit, designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use. It was created in 1993 by Urban Müller.

The name of the language is generally not capitalized except at the start of a sentence, although it is a proper noun.
